# Changes

## Version 1.3 - October 8, 2019

Before leaving class, we added a psuedorandom number generator to prepare for the next step when fish can move randomly

* Added random number generator

## Version 1.2 - October 8, 2019

In the next exercises, we utilized constructors and methods to make the fish change directions and improve the animation. We then saved our changes. Using GitHUb to commit changes and sync (push) back to the origin.

* The fish will now change directions
* The infinite loop has been added, but the original code is still there (simply change the -- to ++ to create a limit of refreshes)

## Version 1.1 - October 3, 2019

In the exercises, we improved the simulation.

* Added welcome message
* Added the fish to the simulation
* Show the display simulation
* Move the fish forward and allow redisplaying of the window
